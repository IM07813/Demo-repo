   b. Balance assignments based on:
      - Current month's total assignments per agent
      - Agent specialization
      - Agent capacity

3. In your daily team huddle, review the Google Sheet to ensure:
   a. Fair distribution of leads
   b. Appropriate matching of leads to agent expertise
   c. Adjustments for agents who are on vacation or at capacity

4. Update the "Assigned Agent" property in HubSpot manually based on this rotation system
```

#### Manual Follow-up System
```
Without full automation workflows:

1. Use Contact Views to create "follow-up buckets":
   a. Go to Contacts > Views > Create view
   b. Create views like:
      - "Follow up today"
      - "Follow up this week"
      - "Long-term nurture"
      - "No recent activity (30+ days)"

2. Create recurring tasks using the Task templates:

   b. Use task due dates to manage follow-up schedules

3. Set up Google Calendar reminders:
   a. Create calendar events for important follow-ups
   b. Set specific times for checking different contact views

4. Use the "Last Contact Date" property:
   a. Update this date manually after each meaningful interaction
   b. Use this field to filter contacts who need attention
```
